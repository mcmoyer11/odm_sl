# A candidate has an input, an output, and a violation count for each constraint.
# It also has a field (+opt+) indicating whether the candidate is asserted to be
# optimal, denied being optimal, or neither. Finally, a candidate has
# a list of the constraints in the system, a label, and a remarks string.
class Candidate

  # The input form
  attr_accessor :input

  # The output form
  attr_accessor :output

  # The label of the candidate (often the candidate number)
  attr_accessor :label

  # An optional string for incidental comments on the candidate
  attr_accessor :remark

  # Create a candidate from the given parameters.
  # The candidate is initialized with no label, no remark, no violation
  # counts assigned for any of the constraints,
  # and it is not a merged candidate. At the least, violation counts
  # must be subsequently assigned to each constraint via set_viols().

  # 
  # * +input+ - the input structure
  # * +output+ - the output structure
  # * +optimal+ - indicates that the candidate is asserted optimal ("Y"),
  #   denied optimal ("N") or optionally optimal (nil).
  # * +constraints+ - a list of the constraint objects for the system; must
  #   be convertable to Array via +constraints.to_a+.
